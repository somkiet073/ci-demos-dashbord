DevExtreme supplies several React components used to&nbsp;represent data collections and allow a&nbsp;user to&nbsp;perform actions on&nbsp;the view. These components are showcased in&nbsp;this section. Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are included. In&nbsp;addition, you can use template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) for advanced&nbsp;UI customization.
